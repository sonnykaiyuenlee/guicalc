Welcome to my first personal project: A GUI Calculator!

Notes from the creator: I made this GUI calculator as a simple, first personal project to get my feet wet in working with new packages, documentation, and understanding the organization that is required in building programs from scratch.  

To run:
1) Download the repository
2) navigate to the repository folder
3) install the required wxpython package with this command: pip install wxPython 
4) if running on windows run this command: python calc.py
5) if running on mac run this command: pythonw calc.py

NOTE: Please make sure to read the welcome messages as that will help you understand what commands you can use and how to represent them!

ENJOY!
